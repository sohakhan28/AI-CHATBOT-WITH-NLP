An AI Chatbot built using Python with NLTK and spaCy for Natural Language Processing. The chatbot can handle greetings, introduce itself, explain tasks, and exit gracefully. It demonstrates both rule-based (NLTK) and semantic similarity (spaCy) approaches for intelligent conversation.The chatbot program is designed as part of the CodTech internship task to demonstrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python. Two implementations have been provided: one with NLTK and another with spaCy. The NLTK-based chatbot works on a simple pattern-matching approach, where predefined patterns are mapped to responses, making it effective for rule-based conversations. On the other hand, the spaCy-based chatbot is more advanced as it uses semantic similarity to understand user queries and match them with the closest intent, allowing for more flexible and natural interactions. Both versions can respond to greetings, introduce themselves, explain their task, and end the conversation gracefully. While the NLTK chatbot is easy to implement and suitable for beginners, the spaCy chatbot is scalable and closer to real-world AI assistants. Together, they provide a foundation for building intelligent conversational agents using Python and NLP libraries.
